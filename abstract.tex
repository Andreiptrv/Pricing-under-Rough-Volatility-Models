In the present paper we investigate the roughness of the Russian stock market in the context of the 
rough stochastic volatility model. We obtain the estimation of the Hurst parameter and the 
Zumbach effect. We also obtain an estimation of a bias using modern approaches in Data Science and 
Applied Statistics. In the end we form the conclusion that the rough volatility model is a XXX working
model for the Russian stock market and formulate the future research horizon.
