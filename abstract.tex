In the present paper we investigate the roughness of the Russian stock market. 
In order to do this, we study the behavior of the Zumbach effect in real market data and 
non-rough stochastic volatility model Monte-Carlo simulations. After that we study the RFSV 
model and we obtain the estimation of the Hurst parameter for the 
major Russian corporations. Futhermore, we investigate the sample normalized variation statistic 
and see that roughness could vary depending on estimation of volatility.
