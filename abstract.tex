In the present paper we investigate the roughness of the Russian stock market in the context of the 
rough stochastic volatility model. We obtain the estimation of the Hurst parameter for the 
major Russian corporations. In the end we form the conclusion that the rough volatility model 
is a working model for the Russian stock market and formulate the future research horizon.
