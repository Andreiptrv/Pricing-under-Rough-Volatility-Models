abstract = {The contract price on a forward contract stays fixed for the life of the contract, while a futures contract is rewritten every day. The value of a futures contract is zero at the start of each day. The expected change in the futures price satisfies a formula like the capital asset pricing model. If changes in the futures price are independent of the return on the market, the futures price is the expected spot price. The futures market is not unique in its ability to shift risk, since corporations can do that too. The futures market is unique in the guidance it provides for producers, distributors, and users of commodities. Using assumptions like those used in deriving the original option formula, we find formulas for the values of forward contracts and commodity options in terms of the futures price and other variables. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

@article{ComteRenault1998,
abstract = {This paper studies a classical extension of the Black and Scholes model for option pricing, often known as the Hull and White model. Our specification is that the volatility process is assumed not only to be stochastic, but also to have long-memory features and properties. We study here the implications of this continuous-time long-memory model, both for the volatility process itself as well as for the global asset price process. We also compare our model with some discrete time approximations. Then the issue of option pricing is addressed by looking at theoretical formulas and properties of the implicit volatilities as well as statistical inference tractability. Lastly, we provide a few simulation experiments to illustrate our results.},

@article{GatheralRosenbaum2014,
abstract = {Estimating volatility from recent high frequency data, we revisit the question of the smoothness of the volatility process. Our main result is that log-volatility behaves essentially as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent H of order 0.1, at any reasonable timescale. This leads us to adopt the fractional stochastic volatility (FSV) model of Comte and Renault [Long memory in continuous-time stochastic volatility models. Math. Finance, 1998, 8(4), 291–323]. We call our model Rough FSV (RFSV) to underline that, in contrast to FSV, H < 1/2.. We demonstrate that our RFSV model is remarkably consistent with financial time series data; one application is that it enables us to obtain improved forecasts of realized volatility. Furthermore, we find that although volatility is not a long memory process in the RFSV model, classical statistical procedures aiming at detecting volatility persistence tend to conclude the presence of long memory in data generated from it. This sheds light on why long memory of volatility has been widely accepted as a stylized fact.},

Using this principle, a theoretical valuation formula for options is derived. Since almost all corporate liabilities can be viewed as combinations of options, the formula and the analysis that led to it are also applicable to corporate liabilities such as common stock, corporate bonds, and warrants. In particular, the formula can be used to derive the discount that should be applied to a corporate bond because of the possibility of default.},

Simulations show that correlation between volatility and the spot asset's price is important for explaining return skewness and strike-price biases in the Black- Scholes (1973) model. The solution technique is based on characteristic functions and can be applied to other problems.},

abstract = {We investigate the statistical evidence for the use of `rough' fractional processes with Hurst exponent $H < 0.5$ for the modeling of volatility of financial assets, using a model-free approach. We introduce a non-parametric method for estimating the roughness of a function based on discrete sample, using the concept of normalized $p$-th variation along a sequence of partitions. We investigate the finite sample performance of our estimator for measuring the roughness of sample paths of stochastic processes using detailed numerical experiments based on sample paths of fractional Brownian motion and other fractional processes. We then apply this method to estimate the roughness of realized volatility signals based on high-frequency observations. Detailed numerical experiments based on stochastic volatility models show that, even when the instantaneous volatility has diffusive dynamics with the same roughness as Brownian motion, the realized volatility exhibits rough behaviour corresponding to a Hurst exponent significantly smaller than $0.5$. Comparison of roughness estimates for realized and instantaneous volatility in fractional volatility models with different values of Hurst exponent shows that, irrespective of the roughness of the spot volatility process, realized volatility always exhibits `rough' behaviour with an apparent Hurst index $\hat{H}<0.5$. These results suggest that the origin of the roughness observed in realized volatility time-series lies in the microstructure noise rather than the volatility process itself.},

The finite sample properties of the spectral likelihood estimator are analyzed by means of a Monte Carlo study.

The continuous time framework allows to reconcile two competitive types of modelling: fractional integration of ARMA processes and fractional Brownian Motion. A comparison with usual discrete time ARFIMA models is lead. Some well-known empirical evidence on macroeconomic and financial time series, such as variability of forward rates, aggregation of responses across heterogeneous agents, are well-captured by this continuous time modelling. Moreover, the usual statistical tools for long memory series and for Stochastic Differential Equations can be jointly applied in this setting.},

   abstract = {A 'long memory' property of stock market returns is investigated in this paper. It is found that not only there is substantially more correlation between absolute returns than returns themselves, but the power transformation of the absolute return |rt|d also has quite high autocorrelation for long lags. It is possible to characterize |rt|d to be 'long memory' and this property is strongest when d is around 1. This result appears to argue against ARCH type specifications based upon squared returns. But our Monte-Carlo study shows that both ARCH type models based on squared returns and those based on absolute return can produce this property. A new general class of models is proposed which allows the power δ of the heteroskedasticity equation to be estimated from the data. © 1993.},

We show that the Langevin equation with fractional Brownian motion noise also has a stationary solution and that the decay of its auto-covariance function is like that of a power function. Contrary to that, the stationary process obtained from fractional Brownian motion by the Lamperti transformation has an auto-covariance function that decays exponentially.},
