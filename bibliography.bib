abstract = {Rough volatility models are recently popularized by the need of a consistent model for the observed empirical volatility in the financial market. In this case, it has been shown that the empirical volatility in the financial market is extremely consistent with the rough volatility. Currently, fractional Riccati equation as a part of computation for the characteristic function of rough Heston model is not known in explicit form and therefore, we must rely on numerical methods to obtain a solution. In this paper, we will be giving a short introduction to option pricing theory (Black-Scholes model, classical Heston model and its characteristic function), an overview of the current advancements on the rough Heston model and numerical methods (fractional Adams-Bashforth-Moulton method and multipoint Pade approximation method) for solving the fractional Riccati equation. In addition, we will investigate on the performance of multipoint Pade approximation method for the small u values in D$\alpha$h(u-i/2, x) as it plays a huge role in the computation for the option prices. We further confirm that the solution generated by multipoint Pade (3,3) method for the fractional Riccati equation is incredibly consistent with the solution generated by fractional Adams-Bashforth-Moulton method.},

@article{Alos2021,
abstract = {Here, we review some results of fractional volatility models, where the volatility is driven by fractional Brownian motion (fBm). In these models, the future average volatility is not a process adapted to the underlying filtration, and fBm is not a semimartingale in general. So, we cannot use the classical It{\^{o}}'s calculus to explain how the memory properties of fBm allow us to describe some empirical findings of the implied volatility surface through Hull and White type formulas. Thus, Malliavin calculus provides a natural approach to deal with the implied volatility without assuming any particular structure of the volatility. The aim of this paper is to provides the basic tools of Malliavin calculus for the study of fractional volatility models. That is, we explain how the long and short memory of fBm improves the description of the implied volatility. In particular, we consider in detail a model that combines the long and short memory properties of fBm as an example of the approach introduced in this paper. The theoretical results are tested with numerical experiments.},

@article{Duarte2007,
abstract = {We analyze the volatility risk premium by applying a modified two-pass Fama-MacBeth procedure to the returns of a large cross section of the returns of options on individual equities. Our results provide strong evidence of a volatility risk premium that is increasing in the level of overall market volatility. This risk premium provides compensation for risk stemming both from the characteristics of the option contract and the riskiness of the underlying equity. We also show with a large scale Monte Carlo simulation that measurement error in option prices and violations of arbitrage bounds induce highly economically significant biases in the mean returns of options. In fact, our simulation results demonstrate that biases can be up to several percentage points per day. These large biases can lead researchers to faulty conclusions with respect to both the magnitude of the volatility risk premium and the sign of expected option returns.},

@article{Heston1993,
abstract = {I use a new technique to derive a closed-form solution for the price of a European call option on an asset with stochastic volatility. The model allows arbitrary correlation between volatility and spot-asset returns. I introduce stochastic interest rates and show how to apply the model to bond options and foreign currency options. Simulations show that correlation between volatility and the spot asset's price is important for explaining return skewness and strike-price biases in the Black-Scholes (1973) model. The solution technique is based on characteristic functions and can be applied to other problems. Many plaudits have been aptly used to describe Black and Scholes' (1973) contribution to option pricing theory. Despite subsequent development of option theory, the original Black-Scholes formula for a Euro-pean call option remains the most successful and widely used application. This formula is particularly useful because it relates the distribution of spot returns I thank Hans Knoch for computational assistance. I am grateful for the suggestions of Hyeng Keun (the referee) and for comments by participants at a 1992 National Bureau of Economic Research seminar and the Queen's University 1992 Derivative Securities Symposium.

@article{Albrecher2007,
abstract = {The role of characteristic functions in finance has been strongly amplified by the development of the general option pricing formula by Carr and Madan. As these functions are defined and operating in the complex plane, they potentially encompass a few well known numerical issues due to "branching". A number of elegant publications have emerged tackling these effects specifically for the Heston model. For the latter however we have two specifications for the characteristic function as they are the solutions to a Riccati equation. In this article we put the i's and cross the t's by formally pointing out the properties of and relations between both versions. For the first specification we show that for nearly any parameter choice, instabilities will occur for large enough maturities. We subsequently establish-under an additional parameter restriction-the existence of a "threshold" maturity from which the complex operations become a spoilsport. For the second specification of the characteristic function it is proved that stability is guaranteed under the full dimensional and unrestricted parameter space. We blend the theoretical results with a few examples. 2},

@article{GatheralRosenbaum2014,
abstract = {Estimating volatility from recent high frequency data, we revisit the question of the smoothness of the volatility process. Our main result is that log-volatility behaves essentially as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent H of order 0.1, at any reasonable time scale. This leads us to adopt the fractional stochastic volatility (FSV) model of Comte and Renault. We call our model Rough FSV (RFSV) to underline that, in contrast to FSV, H<1/2. We demonstrate that our RFSV model is remarkably consistent with financial time series data; one application is that it enables us to obtain improved forecasts of realized volatility. Furthermore, we find that although volatility is not long memory in the RFSV model, classical statistical procedures aiming at detecting volatility persistence tend to conclude the presence of long memory in data generated from it. This sheds light on why long memory of volatility has been widely accepted as a stylized fact. Finally, we provide a quantitative market microstructure-based foundation for our findings, relating the roughness of volatility to high frequency trading and order splitting.},
