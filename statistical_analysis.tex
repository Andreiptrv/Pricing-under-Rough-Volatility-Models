    \subsection{Data Preprocessing}
        In our work we used two types of data: high-frequency data from a 
        trading terminal (1m data), and candles from Yahoo Finance (1 day).
        We made the following preprocessing steps:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Created a mean price variable for each time interval ( $\frac{high+low}{2}$ for HF, $\frac{open+close}{2}$for candles )
            \item Estimated the realized volatility as an standard deviation of the assets' log-returns, calculated from mean prices (40 minutes estimation for HF, 20 days for candles)
            \item Plotted the graphs of RV and looked for anomalies, excluded those time periods from consideration
            \item 
        \end{enumerate}
