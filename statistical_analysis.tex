\section{Statistical Analysis}
    \subsection{Data Preprocessing}
        In our work we used two types of data: high-frequency data from a 
        trading terminal (1m data), and candles from Yahoo Finance (1 day).
        We made the following preprocessing steps:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Created a mean price variable for each time interval ( $\frac{high+low}{2}$ for HF, $\frac{open+close}{2}$for candles )
            \item Estimated the realized volatility (RV) as an standard deviation of the assets' log-returns, calculated from mean prices (40 minutes estimation for HF, 20 days for candles) 
        \end{enumerate}
